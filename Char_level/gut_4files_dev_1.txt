UNK and fine words had been given in abundance she could hardly UNK any set of expressions fancy any tone of voice UNK with real love And there would be poor Emma in the carriage behind There is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are Give me the book will write it down then there can be no possible reflection on you ." But perhaps he may never have heard of there being such a creature in the world ." There must be three months least deep UNK when they are over imagine there will be nothing more to wait for ." I understand it was a very handsome letter He came to the part of the room where the UNK - by were collected to some walked about in front of them if to shew his liberty his resolution of UNK it Mrs added that he could only allow himself time to hurry to Highbury breakfast take leave of the few friends there whom he could suppose to feel any interest in him that he might be expected at Hartfield very soon ." you Miss Woodhouse And as to my dear little boys must say if UNK Emma has not time for them do not think they would UNK much better with Uncle Knightley is absent from home about five hours where she is absent one who he is at home either reading to himself or settling his accounts ." It was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax prospects were closing Harriet ' s opened whose engagements now allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury wished to shew her kindness with Emma it was grown into a first wish But hardly had she so spoken she found her brother was civilly offering a seat in his carriage the weather were Mr ' s only objection Mr actually accepting the offer with much prompt satisfaction But her voice )-- nobody speaks except ourselves it is rather too much to be talking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people ." My behaviour the very happy fortnight which I spent with you not hope me open to UNK on one point What I do not mean to say you might not have made discoveries ." It is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned She would not take a denial I should not have thought it possible you could forget what passed in this very room about court - plaister of the very last times we ever met in it !-- It was but a very few days before I had my sore throat before Mr Mrs Knightley came think the very evening .-- Do not you remember his cutting his finger with your new UNK your recommending court - plaister ?-- But you had none about you knew I had desired me to supply him so I took mine out and cut him a piece it was a great deal too large he cut it smaller kept playing some time with what was left he gave it back to me That was the act of a very young man too young to consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure I shall think you a great blockhead you bring the aunt without the niece ." He was too angry to say another word manner too decided to invite UNK in this state of swelling resentment mutually deep mortification had to continue together a few minutes longer the fears of Mr had confined them to a foot - pace I shall not UNK it here It was hardly right it had been so strong an idea it would escape her his submission to all that she told a compliment to her penetration made it difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her tongue I think very well of Mr this is the only way I have of doing him a service ." She was rather low all the evening Emma could allow for her amiable regrets sometimes relieved them by speaking of her own affection by bringing forward the idea of Mr what would Frank Churchill say to her he were here I shall off to - morrow .' She looked back as well as she could it was all confusion They walked thither directly UNK and double dealing seemed to meet him at every turn dear think you play the best of the two The coming of her sister ' s family was so very near at hand first in anticipation then in UNK became UNK her UNK object of interest during the ten days of their stay at Hartfield it was not to be expected did not herself expect any thing beyond occasional assistance could be afforded by her to the lovers The other circumstance of regret related also to Jane Fairfax there she had no doubt Have you finished it ," said Emma UNK when he left them what do you say now to Mr ' s marrying Jane Fairfax ?" I know what your drawings are Only let me be told when I may speak out .-- I wonder whether Jane has any suspicion ." I should not have used the expression Well good news not it You will have no business here .-- Let it stay ,' said she give it UNK till Colonel Campbell comes back yes "-- he replied I was just going to mention it Depend upon it shall soon hear that it is a present from Mr Mrs have no doubt of its being our carriage with Miss Bates and Jane UNK !-- How do you do As a daughter hoped she was not without a heart hope you will bring Elton ," said he but I will not trouble you to give any other invitations ." sweet lines !" I think your manners to him encouraging I want to have your opinion of her looks mother ' s UNK is very trifling you see nothing at all His aunt could not bear to have him leave her She will probably have soon done then we shall go home dear sir no account in the world father can direct me ." who can think of Miss Smith Miss Woodhouse is near No should not have heard it had not been for this particular circumstance her being to come here so soon are sure of excellent fires ," continued he and every thing in the greatest comfort I hope all my heart young man may be a Weston in merit a Churchill in fortune .-- But Harriet Smith have not half done about Harriet Smith I must confess it is a recommendation to me His perception of the striking improvement of Harriet ' s manner her introduction at Hartfield not one of the least agreeable proofs of his growing attachment While you considered me as having UNK against Emma Woodhouse could deserve nothing from either body knows Mrs ," replied Isabella and I am sure I never think of that poor young man without the greatest compassion His rank in society I would alter if I could is saying a great deal I assure you .-- You laugh at me about William Larkins I could quite as ill spare Robert Martin ." as it should be ," said Mr Knightley and just as I hoped it was from your letters But whether he were entirely free from peculiar attachment there were no actual preference a little longer doubtful I am tired of doing nothing is very unfair to judge of any body ' s conduct an intimate knowledge of their situation odd you are Mr ' s loss would be dreadful indeed said Emma But I kept my eye on it soon as I dared it up never parted with it again from that moment ." She had suffered very much from UNK after dancing her first attempt to UNK the bank brought on such a return of it as made her absolutely UNK in this state exceedingly UNK had been obliged to remain shall be happier to burn it ," replied Harriet I do not scruple to say that she plays extremely well They had been speaking of it as they walked about Highbury the day before Frank Churchill had most earnestly lamented her absence A disagreeable truth would be UNK through her lips I am the UNK being in the world at a civil falsehood ." Harriet !" When she looked at the hedges thought the elder at least must soon be coming out when she turned round to Harriet saw something like a look of spring tender smile even there I hope I know better now to care for Mr to be suspected of it ." Her youth had passed without distinction her middle of life was devoted to the care of a UNK mother the endeavour to make a small income go as far as possible So sudden !-- You may guess Miss Woodhouse a UNK it has thrown me in When I am quite determined as to the time am not at all afraid of being long UNK She could now look forward to giving him that full and perfect confidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty Her heart beat quick on hearing Harriet ' s footstep and voice supposed poor Mrs felt when _she_ was approaching Randalls It has been completely unexpected You do not mean it ?" !" With a faint blush presently replied He did not advance a word of praise beyond what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by Mrs he could know very little of the matter He had a very fine UNK she was with them had been bid more for his UNK than any body in the country very true indeed You do not think I could mean _you_ suppose Mr to mean _you_ Emma was sorry ;-- to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like through three long months !-- to be always doing more than she wished less than she ought In the few minutes ' conversation which she had yet had with him Harriet had been partially insensible had spoken of her terror naivete UNK as she seized and UNK to his arm a sensibility amused and delighted just at last Harriet ' s own account had been given had expressed his indignation at the abominable folly of Miss Bickerton in the warmest terms my word dear do not know I never heard the subject talked of ." They seemed to be within half a sentence of Harriet her immediate feeling was to UNK the subject possible she cried in evident embarrassment it all meant nothing mere joke among ourselves ." He had never been an unhappy man own temper had secured him from that in his first marriage his second must shew him how delightful a well - judging and truly amiable woman could be must give him the pleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to UNK than to be chosen excite gratitude than to feel it is April come !" While he lived must be only an engagement she flattered herself if UNK of the danger of drawing her away might become an increase of comfort to him .-- How to do her best by Harriet of more difficult decision ;-- how to spare her from any unnecessary pain to make her any possible atonement to appear least her enemy ?-- On these subjects perplexity and distress were very great her mind had to pass again and again through every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever surrounded it .-- She could only resolve at last she would still avoid a meeting with her communicate all that need be told by letter it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed just now for a time from Highbury in one scheme more resolve it might be practicable to get an invitation for her to Brunswick Square .-- Isabella had been pleased with Harriet a few weeks spent in London must give her some amusement .-- She did not think it in Harriet ' s nature to escape being benefited by novelty and variety the UNK UNK the children .-- At any rate would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself whom every thing was due separation for the present averting of the evil day they must all be together again I never met with a disposition more truly amiable ." She had never rejoiced at the sound before ever before entered the passage walked up the stairs any wish of giving pleasure in UNK obligation of UNK it in subsequent UNK I have now a key to all her odd looks and ways am sure William Larkins will not like it While she talked of his son ' s attention was UNK when she got to Maple Grove could recollect that there were ladies just arriving to be attended to with happy smiles must hurry away and resolved his UNK should be as handsome as possible his wife sat sighing and UNK over her broad UNK with a UNK and good sense and steady !" think her all you describe Emma was not really at all frightened herself this UNK of apprehension by assurances of Mrs ' s experience and care as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she could not wish to reason away she would rather UNK and assist than not added soon afterwards if quite another subject Where a man does his best with only moderate powers will have the advantage over negligent superiority he told me all about it Jane Fairfax and Mr Churchill are to be married that they have been UNK engaged to one another this long while love said that this circumstance would not now make you unhappy I am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected is hotter to - day ." She soon believed herself to UNK Mrs ' s thoughts understand why she was herself happy spirits was being in Miss Fairfax ' s confidence fancying herself acquainted with what was still a secret to other people I had set my heart on Mr ' s marrying Harriet would have been very kind to open my eyes at present I only want to keep Harriet to myself One says those sort of things course any idea of a serious meaning repeated Emma is very likely You and I need not be afraid I go first ` Oh !' There was no bearing such an ;" and to break through her dreadful gratitude made the direct inquiry of ,"-- replied Emma confirmed by the depressed manner in which he still spoke --" I should like to take another turn Consider from how partial a quarter your information came you you on no account .-- I would rather walk .-- And for _me_ to be afraid of walking alone !-- I may so soon have to guard others !" Have you thought dear you shall put her what room there will be for the children ?" She has now been a longer time UNK there she ever was before she begins to want change It was much easier to chat than to study pleasanter to let her imagination range and work at Harriet ' s fortune to be UNK to UNK her comprehension or exercise it on sober UNK the only UNK pursuit which engaged Harriet at present only mental provision she was making for the evening of life the collecting and UNK all the riddles of every sort that she could meet with a thin UNK of hot - pressed paper up by her friend UNK with UNK and UNK Or she may not have resources enough in herself to be UNK for a country life news do you mean ?" Harriet had been at Hartfield usual after breakfast a time gone home to return again to dinner returned sooner than had been talked of with an agitated look something extraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell said she again when they were all in the street On this article I can fully acquit him If you want any farther explanation ," continued he they are paid for it _She_ could not Frank Churchill ' s character was not desperate .-- She was his own Emma hand and word they returned into the house if he could have thought of Frank Churchill then might have deemed him a very good sort of fellow Oh You will not see him Emma wished she had been alone with Mrs true Woodhouse she will My dear Emma own good sense could not endure such a UNK when it came to the point ."

You knew I should not stir till my UNK and master appeared .-- Here have I been sitting this hour these young ladies a UNK of true conjugal UNK who can say know soon it may be wanted ?" you need not imagine Mr to have felt what you would feel in giving up Henry or John no "-- cried Emma as UNK as she could Upon no account in the world The tone implied some old acquaintance how could she possibly guess Emma ' s attempts to stop her father had been vain when he had reached such a point as this could not wonder at her brother - in - law ' s breaking out I give you credit for it The picture !-- How eager he had been about the picture !-- and the charade !-- and an hundred other circumstances ;-- how clearly they had seemed to point at Harriet This moment you please You must go to bed early dear I recommend a little gruel to you before you go .-- You and I will have a nice basin of gruel together Miss Hawkins ,-- I dare say excellent young woman And if they are only beg you to send them home ." UNK is out of health now _that_ indeed her own account has always been Her father ' s comfort was amply secured as well as Mrs being able to come her last pleasing duty she left the house to pay her respects to them as they sat together after dinner while her father was fondly noticing the beauty of her dress make the two ladies all the amends in her power UNK them to large UNK of cake and full glasses of wine whatever unwilling self - denial his care of their constitution might have obliged them to practise during the meal .-- She had UNK a UNK dinner for them wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat it is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor I am sure she _will_ miss her more than she thinks for ." have some news to hear you are come back will rather surprize you ." cried Mr Knightley his own name There was no denying that those brothers had penetration But what shall I say Poor old Mrs and humble as usual as if she did not quite understand what was going on Dear me I can hardly imagine the young man whom I saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well left quite to his own powers yet it is not the style of a woman is too strong and concise UNK enough for a woman My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings of the earth Her heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits of action inequality of powers it mortified her that she was given so little credit for proper feeling esteemed so little worthy as a friend she had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good of being able to say to herself could Mr have been privy to all her attempts of assisting Jane Fairfax he even have seen into her heart would not this occasion found any thing to UNK He went to town on business three days ago I got him to take charge of some papers which I was wanting to send to John .-- He delivered these papers to John his UNK was asked by him to join their party the same evening to UNK ' s Tell me how Miss Fairfax is ." you please don ' t have a great set out He thought much of the evils of the journey for her not a little of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some of the party the last half of the way his alarms were needless sixteen miles being happily accomplished Mr Mrs Knightley five children a UNK number of nursery - UNK reaching Hartfield in safety The very day of Mr ' s going to London produced a fresh occasion for Emma ' s UNK towards her friend Emma watched and decided with such feelings as were now shewn could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily absenting himself he had not been acting a part making a parade of insincere professions that Mr certainly had not done him justice She saw in a moment all the possible good I do suspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself that it was only as an excuse for assisting them ." How unlucky You will not like staying late He is but young his uncle --" Emma was extremely confused yet ," said Emma hastily and with an arch look soon stopping was better know the worst at once hurried on --" And yet may hardly be aware yourself how highly it is To him who has might not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at UNK Her eyes were towards Donwell as she walked she saw him not when should I ever have thought of putting by in cotton a piece of court - plaister that Frank Churchill had been UNK about how could it be ?-- Then I must have UNK it I was completely persuaded Smith walk as if you were tired It is to be a morning scheme know a simple thing What is to become of that ?-- Very true You will not be sorry to find yourself at home ." Jane said so Dixon .-- Very well After a good many compliments to Jane on her dress and look very quietly and properly taken was evidently wanting to be UNK herself it was How do you like my gown ?-- How do you like my trimming ?-- How has Wright done my hair ?" I have heard him say that he could listen to her for ever talk a great deal of the length of this passage dear Emma thought with pleasure of some change of subject It would not have been the awkwardness of a moment would have been rather a pleasure to the suspicions of this very day could have talked to him of Harriet the three - quarters of a mile would have seemed but one I know the danger of indulging such UNK He recommended it for all the children particularly for the weakness in little Bella ' s throat ,-- both sea air and bathing ." Considering the very superior claims of the object ought judging by its apparently stronger effect on Harriet ' s mind reserve and self - command would .-- She must communicate the painful truth as soon as possible said he I just mentioned He can sit down and write a fine UNK letter of professions and UNK persuade himself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his father ' s having any right to complain It was a melancholy change Emma could not but sigh over it wish for impossible things her father UNK made it necessary to be cheerful ` The consequence ,' said she has been a state of perpetual suffering to me so it ought No could not believe it a bad house such a house as a man was to be pitied for having I could almost UNK that you had UNK Mr Churchill Her father ' s feelings were quite distinct At the same time could wonder if Mr should have UNK Woodhouse UNK me UNK on good - humouredly Could I mention any thing more fit to be done to go to Mrs But poor Mrs had a bad cold about a month ago ." Every thing declared it own attentions father ' s hints mother - in - law ' s guarded silence was all in UNK UNK the same story Mr is extremely concerned when any of us are ill The whole party were but just UNK in the drawing - room when Mr made his appearance among them No young lady be sure Mr had so completely made up his mind to the visit in spite of the increasing coldness seemed to have no idea of UNK from it set forward at last most punctually with his eldest daughter in his own carriage less apparent consciousness of the weather than either of the others full of the wonder of his own going the pleasure it was to afford at Randalls to see that it was cold too well UNK up to feel it will not do ," whispered Frank to Emma they are most of them UNK It would be a charming introduction for you have lived so UNK a life I could immediately secure you some of the best society in the place I speak as a friend Nobody talked about it an amiable creature I was !-- No wonder you should hold my speeches in such affectionate remembrance ." The UNK property of Hartfield certainly was UNK but a sort of UNK in the Donwell Abbey estate which all the rest of Highbury belonged their fortune other sources such as to make them scarcely UNK to Donwell Abbey itself every other kind of consequence the Woodhouses had long held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which Mr had first entered not two years ago make his way as he could any UNK but in trade any thing to recommend him to notice but his situation and his civility .-- But he had fancied her in love with him evidently must have been his dependence after UNK a little about the seeming UNK of gentle manners and a conceited head was obliged in common UNK to stop and admit that her own behaviour to him had been so UNK and obliging full of courtesy and attention her real motive unperceived warrant a man of ordinary observation and delicacy Mr fancying himself a very decided favourite As for _his_ going did not wish him to think it possible hours would be too late the party too numerous have lately imagined that I saw symptoms of attachment between them expressive looks I did not believe meant to be public ." Emma saw its artifice returned to her first UNK said Jane her head dear Mrs can have thought of it as I have done ?" After receiving a very indifferent education she is left in Mrs ' s hands to shift as she can ;-- to move short Mrs ' s line have Mrs ' s acquaintance Elton ?" UNK to me ."

His manner had no air of study or UNK Her present home could not but observe unfavourable to a nervous disorder :-- confined always to one room ;-- he could have wished it otherwise her good aunt his very old friend must acknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that description is to say chose to have your walk you were not six yards from your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you Henry and John had seen more UNK than they could UNK long before He will be a completely UNK farmer UNK to appearances thinking of nothing but profit and loss ."

I am sure month ago had no more idea myself !-- The UNK things do take place !" They added to their house their number of servants their UNK of every sort by this time were fortune and style of living only to the family at Hartfield It was his jealousy of Frank Churchill that had taken him from the country .-- The Box Hill party had decided him on going away She must see you ."

I can see nothing at all extraordinary in him now .-- I do not care whether I meet him or not that of the two I had rather not see him indeed I would go any distance round to avoid him I do not envy his wife in the least neither admire her nor envy her I have done is very charming dare say all that I think her very ill - tempered and disagreeable shall never forget her look the other night !-- However assure you Woodhouse wish her no evil .-- No them be ever so happy together will not give me another moment ' s pang to convince you that I have been speaking truth am now going to destroy I ought to have destroyed long ago I ought never to have kept know that very well as she spoke UNK However I will destroy it all it is my particular wish to do it in your presence you may see how rational I am grown How trifling they make every thing else appear !-- I feel now as if I could think of nothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day yet can say how soon it may all UNK from my mind ?" I heard a good deal of Colonel Campbell ' s taste at Weymouth the softness of the upper UNK I am sure is exactly what he and _all_ _that_ UNK would particularly prize There was only Harriet seemed not in spirits herself very willing to be silent Emma felt the tears running down her cheeks almost all the way home being at any trouble to check them as they were And in this style he talked on for some time very properly much attending to any answer altogether sufficiently awake to the terror of a bad sore throat Emma was quite in charity with him His importance at Enscombe was very evident But do come in I know he would be hurt by my UNK in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion In a few minutes the carriage returned .-- Somebody talked of rain .-- will see that there are umbrellas ," said Frank to his father Miss Bates must not be forgotten :" and away he went Miss Bates had just done as Patty opened the door her visitors walked UNK without having any regular narration to attend to only by the sounds of her UNK good - will Only think of those sweet verses --` To Miss UNK It was a sweet view to the eye and the mind There can be no doubt of its being written for you and to you ."
