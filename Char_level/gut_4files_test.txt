Now they seemed in pleasant conversation The doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other Without his sanction I could not hope to be listened to again .-- I spoke were in my favour late event had softened away his pride he was than I could have anticipated reconciled and UNK could say at last man Quite thick shoes One UNK sometimes of a child being ` the picture of health ;' now always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown - up health Let us wait this letter you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you Weston to be out that you must still UNK your own UNK ." While he talked to Isabella found an opportunity of saying This was all very promising for such an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut was nothing to denote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination had given him honour not of being really in love with her being at least very near it saved only by her own indifference for still her resolution held of never marrying )-- the honour short being marked out for her by all their joint acquaintance declare do not know when I have heard any thing that has given me more satisfaction !-- It always has quite hurt me that Jane Fairfax plays so delightfully not have an instrument But what is the meaning of this It will be taking out my freedom .-- I dare say they UNK gloves ." He has not been able to get the Romance of the Forest yet One good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this removal ,-- the ball at the Crown Knightley ?" Instead of forgetting him behaviour was such that she could not avoid the UNK suggestion of it really be as my brother imagined My mother is so delighted !-- for she is to be three months with us at least He told me every thing circumstances and plans what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage CHAPTER XIII Mr and Harriet !-- It was an odd tete - a - tete she was glad to see it .-- There had been a time when he would have UNK her as a companion turned from her with little ceremony was settled last night Frank was off with the light this morning This could not doubt all for herself Are you speaking of Time thought tell him that they ought to be friends again UNK once with the Coles having a ball talked of never took place would be very hard dear poor Isabella were to be anywhere but at Hartfield ." Emma was in no danger of forgetting He might be superseded by another certainly would indeed could be clearer a Robert Martin would have been sufficient nothing else feared cure her word !-- why not your honour !-- why not say upon your honour it has nothing to do with any of them He began to suspect him of some double dealing in his pursuit of Emma He sat a little while in doubt But she had an almost instant doubt of his caring for her as he had done his feeling the same tenderness in the same degree Oh my word ," said Emma I begin to doubt my having any such talent I am sure you must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner the UNK of a voice which I heard to be wholly UNK as I stood here ." He began with great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick - UNK again the present entreat her to UNK _him_ not to venture into such hazard till he had seen Mr and learnt his opinion though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its proper course was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude about her UNK the consequence of keeping you company !-- What do you say to it ?" You will have my sketches time or other look at my UNK to read my poem suppose you have heard of the handsome letter Mr Churchill has written to Mrs Depend upon it he had encouragement ." This has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed did Mr tell you ?" He has had great faults of UNK and UNK I am very much of his opinion in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves still as he is a doubt attached to Miss Fairfax will soon may be hoped the advantage of being constantly with her am very ready to believe his character will improve UNK from hers the steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants The want of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day am ready ," said Emma whenever I am wanted ." That she was really ill was very certain had declared himself convinced of it Randalls Had the same behaviour continued Smith might have been led into a UNK of your views being aware more than myself the very great inequality which you are so sensible of Harriet ' s features are very delicate makes a likeness difficult yet there is a UNK in the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth which one ought to catch ." You must have heard every thing to be sure The thing is determined is affectedly far as I can presume to determine any thing without the concurrence of my UNK and master These amazing engagements of mine have they been And so excellent in the UNK Knightley .' The conviction seemed real looked as if he felt it I had an UNK once sent to me upon my own name I was not at all pleased with The UNK month was the one fixed on far as they dared Emma and Mr She felt that quitting Donwell must be UNK a great deal of independence of hours and habits in living constantly with her father in no house of his own would be much much be borne with Her own behaviour had been so very improper she cried with a most open eagerness --" Never the UNK part of a moment such an idea occur to me I condition for nothing else without music would be a blank to me .'" still will be an old maid I feel that all the apologies should be on my side Good morning to you dear sir make her like myself ." shall be very glad to look it over ," said he but it seems long The hair was UNK the maid sent away Emma sat down to think and be miserable .-- It was a wretched business indeed !-- Such an UNK of every thing she had been wishing for !-- Such a development of every thing most unwelcome !-- Such a blow for Harriet !-- that was the worst of all The possibility of the young man ' s coming to Mrs ' s that morning meeting with Harriet and pleading his own cause alarming ideas The loss of the ball loss of the young man all that the young man might be feeling !-- It was too wretched !-- Such a delightful evening as it would have been !-- Every body so happy He will be here this evening dare say then I will give it him back some nonsense or other will pass between us you shall not be committed .-- Your soft eyes shall chuse their own time for UNK Very thoughtful of Colonel Campbell not it ?-- He knew Miss Fairfax could have no music here Such things in general cannot be too short ." That is too young to settle Emma was more than half in hopes of Mr ' s having dropt a hint The appearance of the little sitting - room as they entered tranquillity itself of her usual employment on one side of the fire Churchill a table near her UNK occupied about her spectacles Jane Fairfax with her back to them on her pianoforte Elton she could be spoken to ready before Mr had reached her with his request to be allowed to hand her into the dining - parlour saying No !--( in an accent meant to be UNK )-- I am sure you have seen and understood me ." !" like your plan ," cried Mr The invitation was everywhere so well received it seemed as if Mrs were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment to themselves .-- Emma and Harriet professed very high expectations of pleasure from it Mr to get Frank over to join them possible proof of approbation and gratitude which could have been UNK with .-- Mr was then obliged to say that he should be glad to see him Mr engaged to lose no time in writing spare no arguments to induce him to come But if I rather imagine making the match you call it only your planning it saying to yourself one idle day I think it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr were to marry her ,' and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards do you talk of success But no sooner was the distress known to Mr it was removed may depend upon me ," said she Frank ' s was the first idea his the greatest zeal in pursuing it the lady was the best judge of the difficulties the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance They are jealous even of his regard for his father you The same civilities and UNK same success and satisfaction place on the morrow accompanied the whole progress of the picture was rapid and happy Never better .-- Don ' t I hear another carriage ?-- Who can this be ?-- very likely the worthy Coles .-- Upon my word is charming to be standing about among such friends There were three others says they hesitated about some time It was after tea that Jane spoke to Mrs My heart was in Highbury my business was to get my body thither as often as might be with the least suspicion Well was persuaded there were two will answer for it mine thinks herself full as clever would UNK any body ' s assistance ." I am UNK in every thing material If she is ill I should be sorry to do her injustice there are some UNK in her character which make it difficult for me to speak of her with the forbearance I could wish Jane was quite longing to go to Ireland his account of things ." I cannot imagine that she will not be continually UNK her visitor with praise offers of service she will not be continually UNK her UNK intentions the procuring her a UNK situation to the including her in those delightful exploring parties which are to take place in the barouche - landau ." It was too old a story .-- Robert Martin had probably ceased to think of Harriet .-- They took a few turns together along the walk .-- The shade was most refreshing Emma found it the pleasantest part of the day I never knew days fly so fast truth was poor dear Jane could not bear to see any body body at all not be denied Mrs had made such a point Mrs had said so much them would really see nobody ." think so you ?-- I wanted the opinion of some one who could really judge Mr ' s UNK and UNK were sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance or UNK UNK equally ill - bestowed They were both in UNK Now attachment to Harriet Smith would have nothing to encounter never saw any gentleman ' s handwriting "-- Emma began also at Mrs stopped perceiving that Mrs was attending to some one else the pause gave her time to reflect Now am I going to introduce him ?-- Am I unequal to speaking his name at once before all these people Her attention was now claimed by Mr being to his custom on such occasions the circle of his guests paying his particular compliments to the ladies ending with her with all his UNK UNK will think Frank ought to ask her ." said she up in his face What is before me see has been a good deal the case dear not to the degree you mention [ Emma by Jane UNK UNK UNK Mr seems an excellent creature a first - rate favourite with me already assure you We have never been there above once since the new approach was made still I have no doubt that James will take you very safely Mr might marry any body Mr had walked in The acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her But it is done are reconciled dearer ever no moment ' s uneasiness can ever occur between us again I am sure you would is nothing to be compared to it I do not pretend to Emma ' s genius for UNK and guessing Do you think him so very plain ?" I must get rid of every thing .-- There it goes there is an end Heaven What am I to do ?" upon it will not do It does relate to him I will tell you directly ;" her work seeming resolved against looking up .) This is great news can never think of it without laughing .-- She UNK us UNK us Woodhouse Mr Churchill still declined it as serious as he could his father gave his UNK support by calling out My good friend is quite unnecessary knows a UNK of water when he sees it as to Mrs ' s may get there from the Crown in a UNK jump ." You must promise me not to sit up ." Well so you actually saw the letter --" I certainly have been UNK you you feel in doubt as to the UNK of your answer soon as I am cooler I shall go back again Nothing should separate her from her father couple !" Fairfax has feeling ," said Mr --" I do not UNK her of want of feeling Your meaning must be UNK doubts or UNK such expressions of gratitude and concern for the pain you are UNK as propriety requires present themselves UNK to _your_ mind am persuaded Mrs had many to agree with her body who spoke on the subject was equally convinced that it must come from Colonel Campbell equally rejoiced that such a present had been made there were enough ready to speak to allow Emma to think her own way still listen to Mrs Now Emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte the remembrance of all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been long enough a repetition of every thing that she could venture to say of the good wishes which she really felt leave Emma grew sick at the sound Mrs had course a very favourable idea of the young man such a pleasing attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense a most welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation which her marriage had already secured A worthy employment for a young lady ' s mind seem determined to think ill of him ." She was vexed beyond what could have been expressed beyond what she could conceal Miss Woodhouse you do forget !" Time knew be allowed for this being thoroughly done she could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general very inadequate to UNK in an attachment to Mr in particular it seemed to her reasonable that at Harriet ' s age with the entire UNK of all hope a progress might be made towards a state of composure by the time of Mr ' s return to allow them all to meet again in the common UNK of acquaintance any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them I met _one_ as I came in such weather !-- absolute madness !" As the sun is out believe I had better take my three turns while I can He seemed to have all the life and spirit feelings social inclinations of his father nothing of the pride or reserve of Enscombe said Mrs in a trembling voice was not that her own doing too They spoke Mrs ' s death with mutual forbearance She was in the adjoining UNK while she still spoke opening the UNK there called Mr ' s attention every syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by the others if it had passed within the same apartment And his voice still more do not see why Miss Fairfax should not be mentioned too Patty makes an excellent apple - UNK Half a minute brought it all out as for me judgment is worth nothing Was not she the whole day with you ?" Mr had spoken UNK he once said Emma have been no friend to Harriet Smith ." Such might be his constitution as she knew that eating and drinking were often the cure of such UNK complaints recommended his taking some refreshment would find abundance of every thing in the dining - room she UNK pointed out the door well am much obliged to you yes and I both saying we liked it Mr ' s seeming resolved to learn to like it too am not fond of dinner - visiting ," said he --" I never was The move began Miss Bates might be heard from that moment interruption her being seated at table and taking up her UNK has been the pleasure am sure papa is what you never have been able to accomplish I do not think you ever will While he staid Martins were forgotten on the very morning of his setting off for Bath again UNK some of the distress it occasioned it best for her to return Elizabeth Martin ' s visit she _shall_ _not_ do such a thing again ," eagerly rejoined Mrs Let every body on the Hill hear me if they can He is an excellent young man will suit Harriet exactly will be an ` Exactly so ,' as he says himself he does sigh and UNK study for compliments rather more than I could endure as a principal Much better employed talking to the young ladies Mr looked as if he were more gratified than he cared to express before he could make any reply thoughts were on the Bates ' s You have been no friend to Harriet Smith But Emma still shook her head in steady UNK I do not ." Harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed UNK apparent sense of ill - usage yet Emma fancied there was a something of resentment something UNK on it in her style increased the UNK of their being separate .-- It might be only her own consciousness it seemed as if an angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a UNK That was the kind action was the noble benevolence and generosity was the service which made me begin to feel how superior he was to every other being upon earth ." I wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it No UNK thank you me take UNK .-- A little tea if you please and bye ,-- no hurry were the words them lay the UNK ideas which Emma could not get rid of which UNK the real misery of the business to her She is as low as possible I could so long a time be fancying myself You are not UNK to look UNK than any body else am glad you approve of what I have done ," said he very comfortably is his answer you like to see it ." A charming place Oh He shook his head there was a smile of indulgence with it he only said as I was !-- but I am quite ashamed of it now wish I could forget as easily as I can burn them was too good !-- she could not endure the thought !-- she would not give him such a troublesome office for the world ,"-- brought on the desired repetition of entreaties and assurances ,-- and a very few minutes settled the business dare say ," replied Mrs that I thought so _then_ ;-- but since we have parted can never remember Emma ' s UNK to do any thing I wished ." Is Perry going to set up his carriage It was better to pay my visit "-- Mr was a sort of general friend and UNK she knew Mr looked up to him If this is living in the country is nothing very formidable But her account of every thing UNK so much to be guessed is so very reserved very unwilling to give the least information about any body I really think you may say what you like of your acquaintance with her ." ," said Jane we heard his kind offers heard every thing ." had better go on ," said she It will not be so great a loss of time if you dislike it --" Do you really think it a bad thing ?-- why so ?" ," cried Emma it confesses no such thing I have not the smallest doubt of the issue He seems perfectly UNK for that ." I was ready to have gone with her this will do just as well no hope I shall not be ridiculous about it is too much a matter of fact here it is .-- What two letters of the UNK are there express perfection ?" ever since we had the history of that day have been so fond of Mr She was not less pleased another day with the manner in which he UNK a sudden wish of hers have Harriet ' s picture cannot agree with you To suffer her to engage herself suffer her even to think of such a measure !" It was natural to have some civil hopes on the subject he said So far from having long understood you have been in a most complete error with respect to your views this moment The room at the Crown was to witness it ;-- but it would be better than a common meeting in a crowd She felt immediately that she should like him there was a well - bred ease of manner a UNK to talk convinced her that he came intending to be acquainted with her that acquainted they soon must be For half an hour Mr was surprized and sorry then he began to perceive that Frank ' s coming two or three months later would be a much better plan time of year weather that he would be able any doubt stay considerably longer with them than if he had come sooner it was such an UNK obligation !-- The very recollection of it all that I felt at the time I saw him coming noble look my wretchedness before very fine morning Emma Harriet go very well he could sit still with Mrs the dear girls walked about the gardens It was quite a chance said he had not gone round by Randalls He is a most amiable young man believe They met with the utmost friendliness But the other hand could not admit herself to be unhappy the first morning be less disposed for employment than usual was still busy and cheerful as he was could yet imagine him to have faults farther thinking of him so much she sat drawing or working a thousand amusing schemes for the progress and close of their attachment interesting UNK UNK elegant letters conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his side was that she UNK _him_ had a few lines on parish business from Mr this morning at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened ." The present crisis to be brought on by them those misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the impropriety of his conduct ." They will be so very happy to see you ." Emma ' s only surprize was that Jane Fairfax should accept those attentions and tolerate Mrs as she seemed to do It had not been forgotten before it had been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day how could _she_ bear such behaviour Could she but have given Harriet her feelings about it all His professions and his proposals did him no service I could not think about you so much without doating on you and all by UNK of fancying so many errors been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least ." so you absolutely opened what was directed to her This was the occurrence :-- The Coles had been settled some years in Highbury were very good sort of people unpretending the other hand were of low origin trade only moderately genteel I made the best excuses I could for not having been able to wait on him and Mrs on this happy occasion said that I hoped I _should_ in the course of the summer my word ," she cried the young man is determined not to lose any thing for want of asking It was a good scheme on driving to the door they heard that neither nor mistress was at home ;" they had both been out some time man believed they were gone to Hartfield Why should he marry ?-- He is as happy as possible by himself his farm his UNK his UNK all the parish to manage he is extremely fond of his brother ' s children Let us make the best of it every thing may be fairly said in her favour It might be weeks might be only a few days the horse were UNK no preparations could be ventured on it was all melancholy UNK The first UNK sound to which she felt herself obliged to attend the name of Jane Fairfax He was not a great favourite with his fair sister - in - law In spite of the answer ordered the carriage drove to Mrs ' s the hope that Jane would be induced to join her it would not do ;-- Miss Bates came to the carriage door gratitude agreeing with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatest service every thing that message could do was tried all in vain !" The event was more favourable to Mr than to Emma The apples themselves are the very finest sort for UNK a doubt from Donwell of Mr ' s most liberal supply !-- What do you mean ?" They could go there again with them in the autumn You must know I have a vast dislike to UNK a horror of them do not admire it ," said Mr He gave her a letter was from Frank to herself had met with it in his way had taken the liberty of opening it It is just what I used to say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of UNK things did not go quite right not proceed with all the rapidity which suited his feelings was apt to be in despair exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be _May_ before UNK ' s UNK UNK would be put on for us They had received her UNK not coolly nothing beyond the UNK commonplace had been talked almost all the time just at last Mrs ' s saying of a sudden she thought Miss Smith was grown brought on a more interesting subject a warmer manner CHAPTER II She was sorry could not repent shall soon bring him over to Hartfield ," said he the conclusion I know you will soon call on her is living in dread of the visit This is saying very plainly --` Pray Smith me leave to pay my addresses to you think ," said John Knightley pleasantly that Mr has some little claim I hope they are quite well I must UNK something at Ford ' s a friend !" I was sixteen years old when you were born ." He had no idea of me As long as Mr remained with them ' s fever continued when he was gone began to be a little UNK and subdued in the course of the UNK night was the UNK for such an evening found one or two such very serious points to consider made her feel even her happiness must have some alloy you they will dear Nobody could nurse her we should do ." Harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful She had resolution enough to UNK her own will in spite of her brother not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother ' s unreasonable anger from missing the UNK of her former home ` Not that it was such a very old petticoat either still it would last a great while must thankfully say that their UNK were all very strong .'" He was reckoned very handsome person much admired in general not by her being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense with :-- but the girl who could be gratified by a Robert Martin ' s UNK about the country to get walnuts for her might very well be UNK by Mr ' s admiration There is great fear caution resolution somewhere .-- She is _not_ to be with the UNK I am quite ready It is Frank Churchill ' s duty to pay this attention to his father I forget where we had been walking to likely to Randalls think it was to Randalls They talked at first only of the performance am very much astonished At Hartfield have had very good UNK of well educated bred men He said the first was a very good sort was our great comfort the measles are a dreadful complaint said she Miss Nash thinks either of the Coxes would be very glad to marry him ." I am afraid you must have had a shocking walk ." UNK yourself and your brother do not know his equal for temper girl !" She went to Mrs ' s accordingly the very next day UNK the necessary penance of communication a severe one it was .-- She had to destroy all the hopes which she had been so industriously UNK appear in the ungracious character of the one preferred acknowledge herself UNK mistaken and mis - judging in all her ideas on one subject her observations her convictions her UNK for the last six weeks do not understand what you mean by ` success UNK said Mr After such behaviour I have witnessed during the last month Miss Smith attentions as I have been in the daily habit of observing be addressing me in this manner is an unsteadiness of character I had not supposed possible Do you think it will look well ?" Knightley .-- They had determined that their marriage ought to be concluded while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield allow them the fortnight ' s absence in a UNK to the UNK was the plan .-- John and Isabella every other friend agreed in approving it Invite them both ." told me at parting he should soon write he spoke in a manner which seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now She asked no more questions therefore employed her own fancy that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some money concern just come to light a disagreeable nature in the circumstances of the family ,-- something which the late event at Richmond had brought forward No one believe blame her more than she is disposed to blame herself Harriet was to sit again the next day Mr as he ought for the UNK of attending and reading to them again We shall know more about them all half an hour you Miss Fairfax would have UNK in half a year ." UNK has been the hand !" How do you do Smith ?-- Very well I thank you .-- And I begged Mrs to come with me I might be sure of succeeding ." I can have no self - command without a motive ," said Mr Knightley presently some UNK he seems to have a great deal of good - will towards you ." She had frequently thought since his father ' s marriage with Miss Taylor if she UNK to marry was the very person to suit her in age and condition He had a great regard for Mrs Emma should write a line invite her I think their father is too UNK with them very often ." There was a communication before her which _she_ only could be UNK to make confession of her engagement to her father she would have nothing to do with it at present .-- She had resolved to defer the disclosure till Mrs were safe and well wish we could contrive it ," said she but I cannot think of any tolerable pretence for going in ;-- no servant that I want to inquire about of his housekeeper message from my father ." It was all right open equal I remember saying to myself Even Emma all her partiality for Harriet think this a good match .'" What I said just now nothing Had he said any thing to bear a different construction should not have believed him ." said Mrs have not you finished it yet you do not give another half - second to the subject Could she have chosen with whom to associate would not have chosen her Leave it all to me The speech was more to Emma than to Harriet Emma could understand an extraordinary dream of mine !" She was quite one of her UNK most amiable woman as accomplished and UNK as Mrs meant to be considered Jane looked as if she did not mean to be UNK instead of answering began speaking again to Mr Knightley have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him ." How well she looked last night !" I know myself is an active mind a great many independent resources I do not perceive why I should be more in want of employment at forty or fifty than one - and - twenty What nonsense one talks Woodhouse hard at work one talks at all ;-- your real UNK suppose their UNK we gentlemen UNK if we get hold of a word Fairfax said something about UNK !" It is not Swisserland it will be something for a young man so much in want of a change I will fetch your UNK and open the garden door for you ." Miss Bates would hardly give Emma time to say how perfectly new this circumstance was to her as without supposing it possible that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars of Mr Churchill ' s going proceeded to give them all was of no consequence My mother says the UNK was always famous in her younger days UNK gave you understanding :-- Miss Taylor gave you principles Dear Emma has been to call on Mrs Miss Bates I told you before hope ," said he presently I have not been severe upon poor Mrs have that note can shew it after dinner to convince Mr Emma was in the humour to value simplicity and UNK to the utmost all that was amiable that ought to be UNK on Harriet ' s side her own No amiable young man can be amiable only in UNK in English Emma ' s eyes were instantly withdrawn she sat UNK UNK a fixed attitude a few minutes my dear ,' said I just then came the note Your reasonings carry my judgment along with them entirely I shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me .--` Oh ,' said he wait half a minute I have finished my job UNK For you believe it Woodhouse he is the most obliging manner in the world in the rivet of my mother ' s spectacles .-- The rivet came out know morning .-- So very obliging !-- For my mother had no use of her spectacles not put them on Mr would CHAPTER III cried Emma feelingly She could not be UNK dreaded being UNK heroism reached only to silence ever did think well of the Churchills fancy ," observed Mr Knightley coolly I wish Jane Fairfax very well she UNK me to death ." Happily was now time to be gone Her situation should secure your compassion But you had better go with Mrs and hear the instrument ." Mr must be quiet every thing UNK arranged of us would have us come This does not apply Miss Bates is only too good natured and too silly to suit me general is very much to the taste of every body single and though poor Mrs was spoken of perfectly agree with you ,"-- was then his remark He was no dancer in general Every thing tender and charming was to mark their parting still they were to part She was always having a glimpse of him somewhere or other They were soon joined by some of the gentlemen the very first of the early was Frank Churchill He had been most agreeable delightful had told Harriet that he had seen them go by had purposely followed them little UNK and UNK had been dropt nothing serious I saw a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round Maple Grove is this ?-- What is this ?" Mrs willing to suppose a particular compliment intended her by such a hope most graciously I had no intention thought I had no power of staying more than five minutes I first entered the house It is very plain that he considers the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side that he is not without hope of my growing time worthy of your affection you think me already I promised my wife to leave it all to her I was sure it could not be far off I had put my huswife upon it see being aware so it was quite UNK I had it in my hand so very lately that I was almost sure it must be on the table As to the pretence of trying her native air look upon that as a mere excuse .-- In the summer it might have passed what can any body ' s native air do for them in the months of January UNK A week to - morrow !-- And I have hardly begun to enjoy myself The misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly careful as to your associates You have not heard all that you ought to hear Her father Harriet You do not know it I dare say two or three years ago I had a great passion for taking likenesses attempted several of my friends was thought to have a tolerable eye in general UNK dancing indeed !-- Yes dear ran home I said I should help grandmama to bed got back again nobody missed me .-- I set off without saying a word as I told you But you will do every thing right She was extremely angry with herself But I think dear said you had got it ." At last Emma attacked her on another ground This card - room would be wanted as a card - room now cards were UNK UNK unnecessary by their four selves was it not too small for any comfortable supper _is_ feeling here .-- He does seem to have suffered in finding her ill .-- Certainly can have no doubt of his being fond of her Mrs looked surprized said I did not know that he ever had any such plan ." UNK inequality of fortune perhaps a little disparity of age can see nothing unsuitable ." And as for Mrs holds her very cheap indeed .-- She promised Wright a UNK never sent it ." ," said Emma there is no UNK about taste .-- At least you admire her except her complexion ." Miss Churchill of age with the full command of her fortune her fortune bore no proportion to the family - estate not to be UNK from the marriage it took place the infinite mortification of Mr Mrs threw her off with due decorum We never were so long without seeing her before as I was telling Mrs shall hardly know how to make enough of her now ." When he did return sought out the child and took notice of her He came with Mrs whom and to Highbury he seemed to take very cordially UNK UNK twelve shall not forget to think of you four hours hence by this time to - morrow a little later may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here The weather added what it could of gloom I am not one of those who have witty things at every body ' s service present from the Campbells ," said she --" this pianoforte is very kindly given ."
